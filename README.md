# RIA_final_project
In this repository we do not have the main dataset used due to the too large size of it for free version of github.
We used dataset from Conte, M., P. Cotterlaz and T. Mayer (2022), "The CEPII Gravity database". CEPII Working Paper NÂ°2022-05, July 2022.

For accessing the database please download it from the original source http://www.cepii.fr/cepii/en/bdd_modele/versions.asp?id=8 or follow this link https://ugentbe-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/kateryna_hanina_ugent_be/Ec-VifC9ZRxGqzxJFsPgInYBc6BgHQvB634W8IYUnGJTIg?e=PEGU3I

This project estimates the effects of ASEAN+1 agreement with Japan and contains R code for gravity models as well as R code for descriptive analysis.
Additionally, all the figures and tables created are stored here.
